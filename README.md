This repo serves a few functions:
1) it contains my dotfiles (.bash_profile, .vimrc) etc. in case I break them
2) (THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT READY YET) It should contain an install script that allows anybody to install a tmux/vim-with-plugin setup in an environment without sudo privileges (useful for remote working from a server, for example).

Feel free to fork and edit, and raise issues/PRs for any suggestions.
